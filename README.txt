It also serves as a real world proving ground for possible future enhancements to the standard library version.

Development
-----------

contextlib2 currently has no dependencies.

Local testing is currently just a matter of running "python test_contextlib2.py"

Continuous integration
----------------------

CI is set up in Codeship to run against PRs and commits.
